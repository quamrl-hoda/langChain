## 🌟 Overview  

Hi there! 👋  
I’m **Quamrul Hoda**, a **B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML)**.  
This repository contains all my **LangChain learning projects, experiments, and practice scripts**.  

I’ve **completed my LangChain learning** and gained **hands-on practical experience** by building multiple small projects — including LLM-based apps, data loaders, and AI workflows.  
This repository reflects my progress, coding practice, and understanding of how to use LangChain effectively with **OpenAI** and **Hugging Face** models.

## 🧩 What’s Inside  

This repository covers core LangChain concepts with practical implementations:

- ⚙️ **LangChain Basics** — Setup and Introduction  
- 💬 **Prompt Templates** — Building structured prompts  
- 🔗 **Chains** — Sequential & Conditional Chains  
- 🤖 **Agents** — Tools, Actions, and Decisions  
- 🧠 **Runnables** — Lightweight and modular pipelines  
- 📄 **Document Loaders** — Handling files and web content  
- 🔍 **Embeddings & Vector Stores** — Semantic search and retrieval  
- 🌐 **API Integrations** — Connecting OpenAI & Hugging Face models

## ⚙️ Getting Started  

###  Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/quamrl-hoda/langChain.git
cd langChain
````

###  Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run an Example
```bash
python 4.chains/conditional_chain.py
```

### ⚠️ Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project root and add your API keys (keep them secret!):

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
```

---

## 🚀 Example: “Hello LangChain”

Here’s a simple LangChain example that uses an **LLMChain** to generate text from a prompt.

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Initialize LLM
llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# Create a prompt
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("What is LangChain and why is it useful?")

# Create a chain
chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)

# Run the chain
response = chain.run({})
print(response)
```

💡 **Output Example:**

```
LangChain is a framework for building applications powered by language models. 
It helps developers connect LLMs with data, tools, and APIs to create intelligent workflows.
```
